# Tuple is a collection of values separated by comma and enclosed in parenthesis. 
# Unlike lists, tuples are immutable.
# The immutability can be considered as the identifying feature of tuples.
# Tuples are similar to lists, but they are not mutable. i.e immutable


t = (1,2,3)

# type of the object
type(t) 

t1 = ('s','b','a','b','c','c')
t1.count('c')
