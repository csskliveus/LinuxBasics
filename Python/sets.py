# Set is an unordered collection of distinct immutable objects. 
# A set contains unique elements. 
# Although sets are mutable, the elements of sets must be immutable. 
# There is no order associated with the elements of a set. 
# Thus, it does not support indexing or slicing like we do with lists.
myset = set()

myset.add(1)
