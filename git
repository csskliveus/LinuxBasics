1. git merge preserves the ancestory of commits

2. git rebase, on the other hand, 
  re-writes the changes of one branch onto another branch without the creation of a merge commit:
  rebase - replays your commits on top of the new base.

3. Choosing the right method:
  - feature based workflow , git merge is the right choice.
        - preserving commit history.
        - Avoids unnecessary git reverts or resets. 

4. linear history
  - git rebase is the best option. 
  - avoid unnecessary commits

5. Dangers of rebasing
    - re-writing the commit history.
      - if some one else checks out your branch before we rebase ours then 
        it would really har to figure out what the history of each branch is.

6. Some of the key points to keep in mind are:
    - rebase only your own local branches.
    - Don’t rebase public branches.
    - Undo rebase with git reflog.
    - reverting a rebase is much more difficult than reverting a merge if there are many conflicts.

7. git clone:
    - Creates of copy of existing git repo.

8. Can you explain 'head' in terms of git and also tell the number of heads that can be present in a repository?

    - A head is nothing but a reference to the last commit object of a branch.
    - For every repository, there will always be a default head referred to as “master” or now “main” (as per GitHub) but there is no restriction to the count of heads available. 
      In other words, it can have any number of heads. 

9. What does git status command do?
  - Git status command is used for showing the difference 
      between the working directory and the index which is helpful for 
      understanding git in-depth and also keep track of the tracked and non-tracked changes.

10. git stash
  - Git stash can be used in cases where we need to 
      switch in between branches and at the same time not wanting to lose edits in the current branch.
  - Running the git stash command basically pushes the current working directory state and index to the stack for future use 
      and thereby providing a clean working directory for other tasks.
  - git stash apply
      will bring back all changes saved in stash.

11. Difference between git pull and git fetch
  - git pull = git fetch + git merge
