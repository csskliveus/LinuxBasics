Impossible to manage service correctly, without understanding
 - which behaviors really matter for that service
 - how to measure and evaluate those behaviors. 

 SLI - Service level indicators
 SLO - Service level objectives
 SLA - Service level agreements

Service level indicator - a carefully defined 'quantitative measure of some aspect' of the level of service.
  - Request latency
  - error rate
  - system throughput
  - availability

Service level objective
  - Target value
  - A natural structure for SLOs is thus 
    - SLI ≤ target / ower bound ≤ SLI ≤ upper bound
    - or lower bound ≤ SLI ≤ upper bound.

  - Ex: Lets say the target set is 100 milliseconds. 
      Setting a target will motivate people to write low-latency code and techniquies that helps in latency. 
    
  Choosing and publishing SLOs to users sets expectations about how a service will perform.

Service level agreement-SLA
  - Finally, SLAs are service level agreements: 
    an explicit or implicit contract with your users that includes consequences of meeting (or missing) the SLOs they contain.


Standardize 
  Aggregation intervals: “Averaged over 1 minute”
  Aggregation regions: “All the tasks in a cluster”
  How frequently measurements are made: “Every 10 seconds”
  Which requests are included: “HTTP GETs from black-box monitoring jobs”
