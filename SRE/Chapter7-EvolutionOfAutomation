- Doing automation thoughtlessly can create as many problems as it solves.
- Always try to work towards creating a platform.



What exactly is the value of automation ? 
 1. Consistency
 2. A Platform
 3. Faster Repairs
 4. Faster Action
 5. Time saving


  1. Consistency:
  2. A Platform: 
    - Designed and done properly, automatic systems also provide a platform that can be extended, 
      applied to more systems, or perhaps even spun out for profit.
    - Platform also centralizes mistakes.
      - In other words, a bug fixed in the code will be fixed there once and forever, 
        unlike a sufficiently large set of humans performing the same procedure, as discussed previously.
  3. Faster Repairs
    - If automation runs regularly and successfully enough, the result is a reduced mean time to repair (MTTR) for those common faults.
    - Problems that occur in actual production are most expensive to fix, both in terms of time and money, 
        which means that an automated system looking for problems as soon as they arise has a good chance of lowering the total cost of the system, 
        given that the system is sufficiently large.
  4. Faster Action
    - 


Value for Google SRE:
  - The factors of consistency, quickness, and reliability dominate most conversations about the trade-offs of performing automation.
  - Google is ideologically bent upon using machines to manage machines where possible, reality requires some modification of our approach
  - we have chosen to create platforms where we could, or to position ourselves so that we could create platforms over time. 
  - We view this platform-based approach as necessary for manageability and scalability.

The use cases for Automation:

  - Automation: Software to act on another software. 
  - Google Automation: The context for our automation is often automation to manage the lifecycle of systems, not their data.
