Repositories:

1. YAML pipeline : The repository in which YAML file is present is called 'self' repository. 

2. CI Triggers: CI trigger causes a pipeline to run whenever you push an update to specified branches.
    1. Branches: Triggers can be controlled branch wise. 
    2. Batching CI runs: When there are multiple teams working on the repo, all the changes can be grouped and triggered.
        trigger:
          batch: true
    3. Paths: We can specify path of the folder to trigger requests.
    4. Opt out of CI: trigger: none , will not trigger any requests. 
3. Skipping CI:
    1. [skip ci] or [ci skip]
4. Trigger Type:
  1. system variable "Build.Reason" will give trigger type. We can control steps or jobs based on trigger type. 
  2. PR triggers:
      1. PR trigger causes pipeline to run whenever a pull request is opened with one of the specified target branches.
5. Checkoutpath:
    - If you are checking out a single repo, source code will be checked out into a directory called 's'. 
        - path is "C:\agent\_work\1\s"
    - If you specify a path for checkout then checkout path will be
        - ex: path is 'newrepo' , then checkout path will be "C:\agent\_work\1\newrepo"
