Network Watcher is an Azure service that combines tools in a central place to diagnose the health of Azure networks. The Network Watcher tools are divided into two categories:

  Monitoring tools
  Diagnostic tools

  1. Monitoring tools
      Network Watchers provides three monitoring tools:
        Topology
        Connection Monitor
        Network Performance Monitor


      TopologyTool: 
        The topology tool generates a graphical display of your Azure virtual network, its resources, its interconnections, and their relationships with each other.

      ConnectionMonitor:
        The Connection Monitor tool provides a way to check that connections work between Azure resources. 
        To check that two VMs can communicate if you want them to, use this tool.
        This tool also measures the latency between resources.

      What is the Network Performance Monitor tool?
        The Network Performance Monitor tool enables you to track and alert on latency and packet drops over time. 
        It gives you a centralized view of your network.
        You can use Network Performance Monitor to monitor endpoint-to-endpoint connectivity:
          Between branches and datacenters.
          Between virtual networks.
          For your connections between on-premises and the cloud.
          For Azure ExpressRoute circuits.
