1. Connect your on-premises network to Azure with VPN Gateway
    - VPNs use an encrypted tunnel within another network. 
    - They're typically deployed to connect two or more trusted private networks to one another over an untrusted network (typically the public Internet). 
    - Traffic is encrypted while traveling over the untrusted network to prevent eavesdropping or other attacks.

  Azure VPN Gateways:
    - Connect on-premises datacenters to Azure virtual networks through a site-to-site connection.
    - Connect individual devices to Azure virtual networks through a point-to-site connection.
    - Connect Azure virtual networks to other Azure virtual networks through a network-to-network connection.


  VPN gateway sizes
  The capabilities of your VPN gateway are determined by the SKU or size that you deploy. This table shows the main capabilities of each available SKU:

  VPN GATEWAY SIZES
    SKU	      Site-to-site/VNet-to-VNet tunnels	Aggregate throughput benchmark	Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) support
    Basic*	    Maximum: 10	                      100 Mbps	                      Not supported
    VpnGw1/Az 	Maximum: 30	                      650 Mbps	                      Supported
    VpnGw2/Az	  Maximum: 30	                      1 Gbps	                        Supported
    VpnGw3/Az	  Maximum: 30	                      1.25 Gbps	                      Supported

  Deploy VPN gateways:
    - Virtual network -  Deploy an Azure virtual network with enough address space for the additional subnet that you'll need for the VPN gateway
    - GatewaySubnet -  Deploy a subnet called GatewaySubnet for the VPN gateway. 
    - Public IP address - Create a Basic-SKU dynamic public IP address if using a non-zone-aware gateway.
    - Local network gateway - Create a local network gateway to define the on-premises network's configuration: where the VPN gateway will connect and what it will connect to.
    - Virtual network gateway - Create the virtual network gateway to route traffic between the virtual network and the on-premises datacenter or other virtual networks.
    - Connection -  Create a Connection resource to create a logical connection between the VPN gateway and the local network gateway.

  High Availability scenarios:
    - Active/Standby 
    - Active/Active


2. Connect your on-premises network to the Microsoft global network by using ExpressRoute

  With ExpressRoute, your data doesnâ€™t travel over the public internet, so it's not exposed to the potential risks associated with internet communications. 
  ExpressRoute is a private connection from your on-premises infrastructure to your Azure infrastructure. 
  Even if you have an ExpressRoute connection, DNS queries, certificate revocation list checking, and Azure Content Delivery Network requests are still sent over the public internet.

    - Azure ExpressRoute lets you seamlessly extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud. 
    - This connection between your organization and Azure is dedicated and private. 
    - Establishing an ExpressRoute connection enables you to connect to Microsoft cloud services like Azure, Office 365, and Dynamics 365. 
    - Security is enhanced, connections are more reliable, latency is minimal, and throughput is greatly increased.

  Features and benefits of express route:
    - Layer 3 connectivity
    - Built in redundancy
    - Dynamic routing [ExpressRoute uses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing protocol.]
    - Connectivity to Microsoft Cloud services.
    - 
    
  Express route connectivity models:
    - CloudExchange co-location: 
        Ex: if your datacenter is co-located at a cloud exchange such as an internet service provider (ISP), 
        you can request a virtual cross-connection to the Microsoft cloud.
    - Point to point
    - Any to Any

  Prerequisites for ExpressRoute:
    An ExpressRoute connectivity partner or cloud exchange provider that can set up a connection from your on-premises networks to the Microsoft cloud.
    An Azure subscription that is registered with your chosen ExpressRoute connectivity partner.
    An active Microsoft Azure account that can be used to request an ExpressRoute circuit.
    An active Office 365 subscription, if you want to connect to the Microsoft cloud and access Office 365 services.

  When to use Azure ExpressRoute
    Consider using the Azure ExpressRoute service in the following scenarios:
    - Low-latency connectivity -  to services in the cloud. In these situations, eliminating or reducing the network overhead will have a significant impact on the performance of your applications.
    - Accessing high-volume systems in the cloud that consume or produce massive volumes of data quickly. ExpressRoute can move data around rapidly, with high reliability.
    - Consuming Microsoft Cloud Services, such as Office 365 and Dynamics 365. 
      - ExpressRoute is especially useful if your organization has a large number of users who need to access these services concurrently.
    - Organizations that have migrated large-scale on-premises systems to Azure. 
        Using ExpressRoute helps ensure that the results of the migrations are seamless for on-premises clients. 
        They should notice no drop in performance. 
        They might even experience some improvement if the previous on-premises systems were restricted by network bandwidth.
    - Situations where data should not traverse the public internet for security reasons.
    - Large datacenters, with a high number of users and systems accessing SaaS offerings.

  Express route circuit:
    Logical connection between your on-prem network and azure network is called circuit.
      - You configure traffic management and routing in ExpressRoute by using circuits.
      - ExpressRoute circuits also support connections through many connectivity providers.

  Benefits:
   - Predictable perfornace
   - Data privacy for your traffic
   - High throughput, low latency connections
   - Availability and connectivity

3. Secure and isolate access to Azure resources by using network security groups and service endpoints
  NetworkSecurityGroups:
    - Network security groups filter network traffic to and from Azure resources.
    - Network security groups contain security rules that you configure to allow or deny inbound and outbound traffic.
    - You can use network security groups to filter traffic between VMs or subnets, both within a virtual network and from the internet.
  
  Augmented security rules
    - Multiple IP address
    - Multiple ports
    - Service tags
    - App security groups
  
  Service tags:
    - VirtualNetwork
    - AzureLoadBalancer
    - AzureTrafficManager
    - Internet
    - Storage
    - SQL
    - AppService
  
  App security groups:
    - App security groups let you configure network security for resources used by specific apps. 
    - You can group VMs logically, no matter what their IP address or subnet assignment.

  Virtualnetwork service end points:
    - Service endpoints let you secure your Azure resources to only your virtual network. 
    - Service traffic will remain on the Azure backbone, and doesn't go out to the internet.
    - Adding service endpoints doesn't remove the public endpoint. It simply provides a redirection of traffic.
  
4.Azure Traffic manager
  Routing methods:
    1. Weighted routing:
        Choose weighted when you want to distribute traffic across a set of endpoints, either evenly, or based on different weights.
    2. Performance routing:
        If you have endpoints in different geographic locations, you can use performance routing to send users to the endpoint that has the best performance for the user. 
        To choose the best endpoint to use, this routing method uses an internet latency table, which actively tracks network latencies to the endpoints from locations around the globe. 
        When a user makes a request, Traffic Manager returns the best performing endpoint based on the location of the request.
    3. Geographic routing
        With the geographic routing method, users are directed to specific endpoints based on where their DNS query originates.
    4. Multivalue routing
    5. Subnet routing
    6. Priority routing
        The Traffic Manager profile contains a prioritized list of service endpoints. 
        By default, Traffic Manager sends all traffic to the primary (highest-priority) endpoint. 
        If the primary endpoint isn't available, Traffic Manager routes the traffic to the second endpoint.
    
    Summary:
      1. Improve performance by serving requests from the closest deployment.
      2. Direct traffic to specific endpoints through priority routing.
      3. Improve application resilience by detecting failures and routing customers to available endpoints.
      4. Perform maintenance or updates without any downtime.
      5. Serve requests from specific geographic locations from specific deployment.
