What is Azure Resource Manager?
  Azure Resource Manager is a service provided by Azure to provide management and application deployment in Azure.
  The resource manager provides the management layer that helps the developer to create, modify or delete the resources in the Azure subscription account. 

1. What do you understand by availability set ? 
  Availability set is nothing by logical grouping of VMS.
    Each VM in the availability set is assigned 2 kinds of domains in Azure
    1. Fault domain
    2. Update domain
  
  Fault domain: All VMS share a common power source and common network switch.
    The VMs within availability sets are separated across up to 3 fault domains by default. 
    This separation of VMs in fault domains helps our applications to be available by reducing impacts of network outages, power interruptions, and certain hardware failures.
  Update domain:
    Grouping of VM's and underlying hardware which are eligible to be rebooted at the same time.

  Azure provides flexibility to configure up to 3 fault domains and 20 update domains for an availability set.

2. Azure storage key
    Used for validating access for azure storage. 
      2 types of azure storage
        1. Primary access key
        2. Secondary access key
  
3. Azure blob storage
    - Object storage solution provided by Microsoft for the cloud.
    - Blob - "Binary large object" 
    - Azure blob have 3 components
      - Storage account
        - Container
          - Blob
             - Block blob - 
             - Page blob - frequent read/write operations
             - Append blob - meant for logging data in log files.

4. Azure storage types
    1. Blob service
    2. Table storage - This type of storage lets user deploy their applications with semi-structured data and a NoSQL-based key-value store.
    3. Queue storage - This storage provides a message queue system for handling large workloads by letting users develop and build flexible and modular applications.
    4. File storage  - This storage type provides features of file sharing that are accessible using SMB (Server Message Block) Protocol. The data in this storage is protected by HTTPS and SMB 3.0 Protocol.

Azure Storage Queue	                                                 Azure Service Bus Queue
  Here, the FIFO (First In First Out) ordering is not guaranteed.	    The FIFO order is guaranteed for the messages by means of sessions.
  Sessions are not supported.	                                        Sessions that are messaging level are supported here.
  Here, only the “At Least Once delivery” model is supported.	        This supports “At least once”, “Atmost once” and “Exactly once” delivery models for the messages.
  There is no automatic detection of duplicates here.	                Automatic duplicate detection is supported here.
  Does not support dead lettering.	                                  Supports dead lettering.
  The size of the message is 64KB.	                                  The size of the message is 256KB.
  Supports one-to-one delivery of messages.	                          Supports both one to one and one-to-many deliveries of messages.
  The transaction is not supported.	                                  The transaction is supported here.
  This queue supports only batch receive.	                            This supports both batch send and batch receive of messages.
  The behavior of receiving messages is non-blocking.	                The behavior can be either blocking or non-blocking based on the configuration.
