Azure Artifacts:

Feed: 
 Feed is an organizational construct to store, manage and group your packages and control who to share it with.

Project-scoped and organization-scoped feeds
  Only project scoped feeds can be made public

Public feeds:
  Public feeds are used to share your packages publicly with anyone on the internet. 
  Public feeds:
    - Can only be created inside of public projects.
    - Public feeds cannot have upstream sources.
    - Public users cannot currently download universal packages. All other package types are supported for public access.

Create a feed:
  2 types of feeds:
    1. Project-scoped
    2. Organization scoped

Difference between project scoped and organization scoped feeds:
  1. Visibility:
      1. If project is public, feed also public.
      2. If project is private, feed also private. 
      3. Org feeds will always remain private.
