An Ansible ad hoc command uses the /usr/bin/ansible command-line tool to automate a single task on one or more managed nodes.

ad hoc commands are great for tasks you repeat "rarely."

Use cases for adhoc commands:
  - Rebooting servers
  - Managing files
  - Managing packages
  - Managing users and groups
  - Managing services
  - Gathering facts
